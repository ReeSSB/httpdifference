                                HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It is a communication
                                protocol or you can it is a method, used to connect to web servers(to
                                recieve & send information) on internet and on intranet(local network).
                                It's primary function is to establish connection and upon request, sends
                                information in many forms i.e, text, images etc through html pages,
                                dislayed by browsers.

                                It is a de facto standard for communication on World Wide Web since it's
                                invention in 1989. Fist usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. It
                                went through several stages of developement. First version of HTTP was
                                called HTTP/1.1 & it is still in use on web. In 21st century, 2015, a
                                newer version of HTTP was created known as HTTP/2. Newer version(HTTP/2)
                                is more efficient & faster, depends on how it prioritizes the loading
                                process.

                                Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a communication
                                standard for the World Wide Web, HTTP is a top-level application
                                protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a
                                local or remote web server. In this process, a client sends a text-based
                                request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST. In response,
                                the server sends a resource like an HTML page contaning text, images, links etc, back to
                                the
                                client.

                                <span class="sub-head">HTTP/2</span> <br>
                                HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google with the intention of
                                reducing
                                web page
                                load latency by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.
                                This
                                protocol
                                served as a template for HTTP/2 when the Hypertext Transfer Protocol working group
                                httpbis of
                                the IETF
                                (Internet Engineering Task Force) put the standard together, culminating in the
                                publication of
                                HTTP/2 in
                                May 2015. From the beginning, many browsers supported this standardization effort,
                                including
                                Chrome,
                                Opera, Internet Explorer, and Safari. Due in part to this browser support, there has
                                been a
                                significant
                                adoption rate of the protocol since 2015, with especially high rates among new sites.

                        <p class="text">HTTP/1.1 sends messages as plain text, and HTTP/2 encodes them into binary data
                                and
                                arranged them carefully. This implies that HTTP/2 can have various delivery models. Most
                                of the
                                time, a client's initial response in return for an HTTP GET request is not the
                                fully-loaded
                                page. Fetching additional resources from the server requires that the client send
                                repeated
                                requests, break or form the TCP connection repeatedly for them.As you can conclude
                                already, this
                                process will consume lots of resources and time.

                                HTTP/1.1 addresses this problem by creating a persistent connection between server and
                                client.
                                Until explicitly closed, this connection will remain open. So, the client can use one
                                TCP
                                connection throughout the communication sans interrupting it again and again.

                                This approach surely ensures good performance, but it also is problematic.

                                For example – If a request at the queue head cannot retrieve its required resources, it
                                can
                                block all requests behind it. This phenomenon is called head-of-line blocking (HOL
                                blocking).

                                From the above, we can conclude that multiple TCP connections are essential.</p>

                        <p class="text">Considering the bottleneck in the previous scenario, the HTTP/2 developers
                                introduced a
                                binary framing layer. This layer partitions requests and responses in tiny data packets
                                and
                                encodes them. Due to this, multiple requests and responses becomes able to run
                                parallelly with
                                HTTP/2 and chances of HOL blocking are bleak.

                                Not only has it solved HOL blocking problem in HTTP/1.1, but it also concurrent message
                                exchange
                                between the client and the server. This way, both of them can have more control while
                                the
                                connection management quality is boosted too.

                                The problems of HTTP/1.1 looks resolved to a great extent here. However, at times,
                                multiple data
                                streams demanding the same resource can hinder HTTP/2’s performance. To achieve better
                                performance, HTTP/2 has another way. It has the capability of stream prioritization.

                                When sending streams in parallel, the client can assign weights (1-256) to its stream to
                                prioritize the responses it demands. Here, the higher the weight, the higher the
                                priority. The
                                serve sets the data retrieval order as per the request’s weight. Programmers can enjoy
                                better
                                control on page rendering process with stream prioritization ability.

                        <p class="text">To accomplish this, HTTP/1.1 has a different technique called resource inlining,
                                wherein
                                the server includes the required source within the HTML page in response to the initial
                                GET
                                request. Though this technique reduces the number of requests that the client must send,
                                the
                                larger, non-text format files increase the size of the page.

                                As a result, the connection speed decreases, and the primary benefit obtained from it
                                also
                                nullifies. Another drawback is the client cannot separate the inlined resources from the
                                HTML
                                page. For this, a deeper level of control is required for connection optimization – a
                                need that
                                HTTP/2 meets with server push.

                        <p class="text">As HTTP/2 supports multiple simultaneous responses to the client’s initial GET
                                request,
                                the server provides the required resource along with the requested HTML page. This is
                                called the
                                server push process, which performs the resource inlining like its precursor while
                                keeping the
                                page and the pushed resource separate. This process fixes the main drawback of resource
                                inlining
                                by enabling the client machine to decide to cache/decline the pushed resource separate
                                from the
